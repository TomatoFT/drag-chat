Project Description: RAG Chatbot Backend
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to:

Upload documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.)

Ask questions based on uploaded documents

Receive contextual answers using a combination of vector similarity search and a language model (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face models)

The backend is built with FastAPI, and data is stored and managed in MongoDB (document metadata and QA history). Embeddings are stored in MongoDB or optionally in a vector database (e.g., Weaviate, Qdrant, or FAISS).

ðŸ“‹ Milestone Breakdown
ðŸ”¹ Milestone 1: Project Setup & Docker Compose
Initialize FastAPI project structure

Set up Docker Compose:

FastAPI backend service

MongoDB container

(Optional) Mongo Express for UI

Configure MongoDB connection in FastAPI

Create basic health check API

ðŸ”¹ Milestone 2: Document Upload & Processing
Implement /upload endpoint:

Accept PDF/DOCX/TXT uploads

Save metadata to MongoDB

Parse and clean document text (use PyMuPDF, python-docx, pdfminer, etc.)

Chunk text into smaller pieces for embedding

ðŸ”¹ Milestone 3: Embedding & Storage
Integrate with a language model to create embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Instructor-XL, etc.)

Store embeddings and chunks into MongoDB (or external vector DB)

Create utility to compute and store document embeddings on upload

ðŸ”¹ Milestone 4: Question Answering Endpoint
Implement /ask endpoint:

Accept user question and document ID(s)

Fetch relevant chunks using similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity with embeddings)

Generate answer using a language model (OpenAI GPT, LLaMA, etc.)

Return answer + source chunks

ðŸ”¹ Milestone 5: Chat History & Metadata
Store chat history (questions & answers) in MongoDB

Enable query filtering by document or user

Optional: Add basic user session support (user ID/token)

ðŸ”¹ Milestone 6: Testing & Cleanup
Write unit tests for key endpoints (e.g., upload, ask)

Clean and structure code into modules (e.g., api, services, utils)

Add basic OpenAPI docs using FastAPI's @router.get("/docs")
